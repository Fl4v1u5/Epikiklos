# Epikiklos v1.0
This program was made by Fl4v1u5 as a maths project for his school. You know, to get good grades.

This program draws epicycloids using envelope curves (curves that are not there, but are drawn using right lines). 
Epicycloids are mathematical abstract objects created as the result of one point in a circumference spinning around another circumference.

Greeks believed that this was the kind of orbit planets made around the Earth, because it is the aparent trajectory of planets seen from the Earth. However we now know planets orbit around the Sun, not around the Earth.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM

You can either modify the values of every variable or just let the program draw the default epicycloid. In this case it draws the most famous one, the cardioid.

The number of epicycles tells us  the number of times that point touches the other circumference creating these special points where the tangent line doesn't exist. Aka, it drastically changes the shape of the objet drawn

This number can either be an integer or a decimal number (that is a number with a period and some other numbers). 

Depending on this value, the drawn figure will change a lot.


The number of segments is the number of segments the circumference will be divided into, and it can either modify the final result a lot or not to do it at all.


**BE AWARE** that if the number of epicycles and the number of segments are either the same or multiples of each other, the final result will either look boring or not appear at all. 
For example, 100 epicycles and 100 segments doesn't draw anything at all.

**ALSO BE AWARE** that if you use huge numbers like 10000000 or 1947357, you may slow down your PC for some time or even for a long time, it depends on your PC's calculation power.
Anything less than 10000 should work just good on most computers these days. If not, just use smaller values.


**ALSO BE AWARE** that very small values like 1 epicycle or 2 work just great and give you cool patterns too, so use them too.

The radius of the circumference is just it's size

And the thickness of the lines can be modified to draw thicker or thinner lines. This one I don't find it particularly interesting to modify so I usually just leave it blank.



Thank you for downloading this program, have a nice day!
